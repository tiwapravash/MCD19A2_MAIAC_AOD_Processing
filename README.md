# MCD19A2_MAIAC_AOD_Processing
This project processes MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data from the MCD19A2 product and creates a NetCDF file containing daily averaged AOD values. The script filters the data based on quality assurance flags, calculates daily averages, and stores the results in a structured NetCDF file.
